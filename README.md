Although the code works, the library is still being polished up in one of my projects.

It will be formally published when the project goes live.

**Until then: Use at your own risk.**

## Motivation

I am **sick** and **tired** of the **overly complex, overly-engineered** frameworks and tools that the JavaScript community is drowning upon to build event driven applications (rective applications if you're into buzz words).

I created this library originally in plain vanilla JavaScript back in angular 1.2 and have been using it to create simple yet scalable applications such as [KPN's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPN), The Netherlands largest telecom [webshop](www.kpn.com/ganesha.html).
